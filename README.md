# Project Jarvis üéØ

Welcome to Project Jarvis, your advanced AI assistant designed to simplify tasks and boost productivity. Whether you're a professional, student, or someone looking to streamline daily routines, Jarvis is here to assist every step of the way.

## Overview üöÄ

Jarvis is more than just another virtual assistant; it's a comprehensive solution packed with powerful features. Combining voice recognition, web scraping, and machine learning into a user-friendly interface, Jarvis makes complex tasks effortless.

## Getting Started üîß

Follow these steps to set up Jarvis on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the Jarvis repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Likhithsai2580/JARVIS.git
    cd JARVIS
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure APIs**: Enhance Jarvis's capabilities by configuring APIs in the `config.json` file.

4. **Setup NLTK**: Install NLTK data needed for text processing tasks.
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    ```

## Features ‚ú®

Jarvis offers a wide range of features:

- **Voice Recognition and Processing**: Communicate using natural language commands.
- **Web Scraping**: Extract data from websites easily.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Extract text from images or scanned documents.
- **Image Generation**: Create visual content dynamically.
- **PowerPoint Presentation Generation**: Automatically generate presentations from text or data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Provide intelligent responses to user queries.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilize machine learning for predictive analysis and personalized interactions.
- **Object Detection with Camera Access**: Perform object detection using the camera, with an efficient Colab notebook.
- **Software Development**: Generate code snippets or complete software.
- **Task Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks and workflows.

## Usage üöÄ

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Jarvis repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Likhithsai2580/JARVIS.git
    cd JARVIS
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**: Launch Jarvis by running `main.py`.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Configure APIs**: Configure free APIs for better performance. Get GEMINI_API [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), cookie_bing [here](https://bing.com), and camera & OCR_Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xenMnAqGydJnsNV5C9aQ4ysrOCdNgXdf?usp=sharing) and [OCR](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/182IO3kVuEtX2fX3RgB4G_nlr_hkFKriD?usp=sharing).

5. **Interact with Jarvis**: Use the GUI interface or voice commands to explore features and execute tasks.

## Performance Optimization üöÄ

To ensure Jarvis runs smoothly on your system:

1. **Use a Virtual Environment**: Isolate Jarvis's dependencies from your system-wide Python installation.
2. **Enable Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce API calls and improve response times.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize Python's `multiprocessing` module for CPU-intensive tasks.

## Troubleshooting üîç

Common issues and their solutions:

- **API Connection Errors**: Ensure your API keys are correctly configured in `config.json`.
- **Voice Recognition Issues**: Check your microphone settings and ensure you're in a quiet environment.
- **Slow Performance**: Consider upgrading your hardware or optimizing resource-intensive features.

## Future Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

Exciting features planned for future releases:

- Integration with smart home devices
- Advanced sentiment analysis for more nuanced interactions
- Expanded language support for global accessibility
- Blockchain integration for secure data management
